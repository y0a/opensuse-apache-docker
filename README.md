- php.ini configured to utilize `getenv()`

# Quick Start

- Pull image from docker
```bash
docker pull nu11secur1ty/opensuse-apache
```
- Run the opensuse-apache-docker image

```bash

# Installation

Pull the latest version of the image from the docker index. These builds are performed by the **Docker Trusted Build** service.

https://hub.docker.com/r/nu11secur1ty/opensuse-apache/

```bash
docker pull nu11secur1ty/opensuse-apache:latest
```

Alternately you can build the image yourself.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/opensuse-apache-docker.git
cd opensuse-apache-docker
docker build -t="$USER/opensuse-apache" .
```

# Upgrading

To upgrade to newer releases, simply follow this 3 step upgrade procedure.

- **Step 1**: Stop the currently running image

```bash
docker stop opensuse-apache
```

- **Step 2**: Update the docker image.

```bash
docker pull nu11secur1ty/opensuse-apache:latest
```

- **Step 3**: Start the image

```bash
docker run --name='opensuse-apache' -d -p 80:80 nu11secur1ty/opensuse-apache
```

# Docker-Compose

Build and run using [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/opensuse-apache-docker.git
cd opensuse-apache-docker
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

The [webapp](webapp) folder on the host will be mounted into the container's apache root

# Docker provides a single command that will clean up any resources — images, containers, volumes, and networks — that are dangling (not associated with a container):

```bash
docker system prune
```


# To additionally remove any stopped containers and all unused images (not just dangling images), add the -a flag to the command:

```bash 
docker system prune -a
```

# Remove one or more specific images

Use the docker images command with the -a flag to locate the ID of the images you want to remove. This will show you every image, including intermediate image layers. When you've located the images you want to delete, you can pass their ID or tag to docker rmi:

- **List:**
```bash
docker images -a
```
- **Remove:**
```bash 
docker rmi Image Image
```
# Remove dangling images

Docker images consist of multiple layers. Dangling images are layers that have no relationship to any tagged images. They no longer serve a purpose and consume disk space. They can be located by adding the filter flag, -f with a value of dangling=true to the docker images command. When you're sure you want to delete them, you can use the docker images purge command:

**NOTE**
```txt
If you build an image without tagging it, the image will appear on the list of dangling images because it has no association with a tagged image. You can avoid this situation by providing a tag when you build, and you can retroactively tag an images with the docker tag command.
```
- **List:**
```bash
docker images -f dangling=true
```
- **Remove:**
```
docker images purge
```
# Removing images according to a pattern

You can find all the images that match a pattern using a combination of docker images and grep. Once you're satisfied, you can delete them by using awk to pass the IDs to docker rmi. Note that these utilities are not supplied by Docker and are not necessarily available on all systems:

- **List:**
```bash
docker images -a |  grep "pattern"
```

- **Remove:**
```bash
docker images -a | grep "pattern" | awk '{print $3}' | xargs docker rmi
```
# Remove all images

All the Docker images on a system can be listed by adding -a to the docker images command. Once you're sure you want to delete them all, you can add the -q flag to pass the Image ID to docker rmi:

- **List:**
```bash
docker images -a
```
- **Remove:**
```bash
docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)
```
# Remove a container upon exit

If you know when you’re creating a container that you won’t want to keep it around once you’re done, you can run docker run --rm to automatically delete it when it exits.

- **Run and Remove:**
```bash
 docker run --rm image_name
```
# Remove all exited containers

You can locate containers using docker ps -a and filter them by their status: created, restarting, running, paused, or exited. To review the list of exited containers, use the -f flag to filter based on status. When you've verified you want to remove those containers, using -q to pass the IDs to the docker rm command.

- **List:**
```bash
docker ps -a -f status=exited
```
- **Remove:**
```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -a -f status=exited -q)
```
# Remove containers using more than one filter

Docker filters can be combined by repeating the filter flag with an additional value. This results in a list of containers that meet either condition. For example, if you want to delete all containers marked as either Created (a state which can result when you run a container with an invalid command) or Exited, you can use two filters:

- **List:**
```bash
docker ps -a -f status=exited -f status=created
```
- **Remove:**
```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -a -f status=exited -f status=created -q)
```
# Remove containers according to a pattern

You can find all the containers that match a pattern using a combination of docker ps and grep. When you're satisfied that you have the list you want to delete, you can use awk and xargs to supply the ID to docker rmi. Note that these utilities are not supplied by Docker and not necessarily available on all systems:

- **List:**
```bash
docker ps -a |  grep "pattern”
```
- **Remove:**
```bash
docker ps -a | grep "pattern" | awk '{print $3}' | xargs docker rmi
```
# Stop and remove all containers

You can review the containers on your system with docker ps. Adding the -a flag will show all containers. When you're sure you want to delete them, you can add the -q flag to supply the IDs to the docker stop and docker rm commands:

- **List:**
```bash
docker ps -a
```
- **Remove:**
```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```
# Removing Volumes
Remove one or more specific volumes - Docker 1.9 and later

Use the docker volume ls command to locate the volume name or names you wish to delete. Then you can remove one or more volumes with the docker volume rm command:

- **List:**
```bash
docker volume ls
```
- **Remove:**
```bash
docker volume rm volume_name volume_name
```
# Remove dangling volumes - Docker 1.9 and later

Since the point of volumes is to exist independent from containers, when a container is removed, a volume is not automatically removed at the same time. When a volume exists and is no longer connected to any containers, it's called a dangling volume. To locate them to confirm you want to remove them, you can use the docker volume ls command with a filter to limit the results to dangling volumes. When you're satisfied with the list, you can remove them all with docker volume prune:

- **List:**
```bash
docker volume ls -f dangling=true
```
- **Remove:**
```
docker volume prune
```
# Remove a container and its volume

If you created an unnamed volume, it can be deleted at the same time as the container with the -v flag. Note that this only works with unnamed volumes. When the container is successfully removed, its ID is displayed. Note that no reference is made to the removal of the volume. If it is unnamed, it is silently removed from the system. If it is named, it silently stays present.

- **Remove:**
```bash
docker rm -v container_name
```
# Conclusion

This guide covers some of the common commands used to remove images, containers, and volumes with Docker. There are many other combinations and flags that can be used with each. For a comprehensive guide to what's available, see the Docker documentation for docker system prune, docker rmi, docker rm and docker volume rm. If there are common cleanup tasks you'd like to see in the guide, please ask or make suggestions in the comments.
